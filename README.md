The course content from which this code stems is primarily interested in heuristic algorithms for finding regulatory
motifs, in the context of locating transcription factor binding sites. 
Specifically Monte Carlo algorithms (gibbs sampling, randomized motif searches) are included in the Jupyter notebook.
